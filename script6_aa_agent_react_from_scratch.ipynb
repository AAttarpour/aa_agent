Clauser, and Anton Zeilinger for their experiments on entangled photons, which have paved the way for more secure quantum communication.\\n2. **Chemistry:** Carolyn R. Bertozzi, Morten Meldal, and Barry Sharpless for the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry, which allow for the creation of new molecules and the study of biological processes.\\n3. **Medicine:** Svante PÃ¤Ã¤bo for his discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and the origins of modern humans.\\n4. **Literature:** Annie Ernaux for the courage and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, alienations, and collective restraints of personal memory.\\n5. **Peace:** Ales Bialiatski, Memorial, and the Center for Civil Liberties for their outstanding efforts to document war crimes, human rights abuses, and the promotion of peace and democracy.\\n6. **Economics:** Douglas W. Diamond, Philip H. Dybvig, and Ben S. Bernanke for their research on banks and financial crises, which has improved our understanding of the role of banks in the economy and the consequences of financial instability.\\n\\nThese are the most recent winners of the Nobel Prizes.
